## Overview
A program that simulates a basic interactive bitmap editor. Bitmaps are represented as an M x N matrix of pixels with each element representing a colour.

### Approach
- I started building the program according to the spec set out in the overview doc. This resulted in a dead-end from a design perspective, with an over-complicated build and poor functionality.
- Facing this point I decided to create a new branch using the initial folder setup with a blank slate for the actual build. This approach adheres much more to an 'MVP' style keeping the program as simple as possible and building complexity step-by-step.

### Testing

Install `rspec`

`$ gem install rspec`

Then run tests:

`$ rspec`
